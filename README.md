# `axcvr.js` (AXCVR for JavaScript)

`axcvr.js` (Audio Transciever library for JavaScript/TypeScript) is an open-source library for transceiving data wirelessly over audio channels.

The audio channels used in the lower versions rely primarily (some exclusively) on near-ultrasonic and ultrasonic (`20+` kHz), making the technology convinient in crouded, noisy spaces where lower frequencies might have to compete with ambient noise polution (most-commonly found in the `20` Hz to `15` kHz frequency range), as well as quiet spaces where too much noise may cause disturbance.
